This Java application simulates Turing Machines of a sole input/output tape.

For it to run, you'll need to specify the runtime arguments in the following way:
1. Config file route: This file must have the same format as those in the tests folder.
2. Input tape entry: If you want to specify the input tape manually through the console, write 'y'. Write 'n' if you want to specify it from a config file.
3. Input tape file(optional): If you've written 'n' as the 2nd parameter, you shall write the input tape config file's path here.
